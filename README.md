Chess game with scaling AI

This is a chess board game that is a work in progress. 
It is not complete and will continue to see changes being made.

Description:
  
   A chess board game that will have a basic UI and AI controlled opponent.
   The AI is planned to have set difficulties that the user can set or change.
   
   So far only the basic structures are set and worked on.
   Ex. Board, pieces, etc.
   
   More changes will come and so will the description.
